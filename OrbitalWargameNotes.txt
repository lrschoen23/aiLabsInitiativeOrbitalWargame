Mission Plan Notes;


- change axis formats on plots


EM/RF people: Billy Gonzolez, scott donel




- sat to sat jamming (is this a realistic modern day concern from an onboard systems standpoint)
  - Yes
- disrupting observations (what's the mechanic behind this)
  - optical observations matter because ground based obs will be slower/more heavily tasked
- Use Backup Communication and Observation Path (this seems like something an operator would not have to do manually)
  - inlcude even though it's probably not realistic
- Disrupt Red Observation via Electronic Warfare. 
  B1 interferes with the red assets in its proximity such that they can no longer properly observe B1
  (what physical mechanic is beind this)
- Execute East/West Stationkeeping Maneuver (what about manuevering outside the box to create more separation)
  - manuevering outside is fine
  


Later/maybe:
- add font size modulation for sensor legend based on main window size
- add markers at maneuver points
- live barchart of game objectives
- add station keeping box to longitude plot
- sensor view for payload with keep out lines





For briefing packet:

- explain all data readouts
- uplinking period before maneuvers/slews happen
- ready mechanic for ground based jamming, secondary comm path
- scoring mechanics
  - using jamming when red is in non-threatening position creates high tension. When red is in threatening position, less so.
  - off-nominal slews and maneuvers incur fuel/nominal operations cost
  - constant drain on objective for as long as off-nominal state persists
- blueSat must be in nominal state to end game
