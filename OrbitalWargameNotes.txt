Mission Plan Notes;

- add station keeping box to longitude plot


- more jamming info/visualizations to react to
- add invisible sc at blue1 location for camera (so that blue1 can slew without messing up body fixed view)
- live barchart of game objectives
- add time based plots behind lower left
- remove status text and add time/date readout



EM/RF people: Billy Gonzolez, scott donel




- sat to sat jamming (is this a realistic modern day concern from an onboard systems standpoint)
  - Yes
- disrupting observations (what's the mechanic behind this)
  - optical observations matter because ground based obs will be slower/more heavily tasked
- Use Backup Communication and Observation Path (this seems like something an operator would not have to do manually)
  - inlcude even though it's probably not realistic
- Disrupt Red Observation via Electronic Warfare. 
  B1 interferes with the red assets in its proximity such that they can no longer properly observe B1
  (what physical mechanic is beind this)
- Execute East/West Stationkeeping Maneuver (what about manuevering outside the box to create more separation)
  - manuevering outside is fine
  
- add predict to longitude radius plot
- try making overlay predict similar to plots
- add markers at maneuver points
