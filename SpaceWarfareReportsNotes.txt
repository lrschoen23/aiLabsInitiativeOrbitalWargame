Space Threat Assessment

Optical dazzling:
- Must come from within sensor FOV.
- Temporarily or permanantly blind optical sensors
- Difficult for attacker to tell if they've been successful
- Can be done from ground with powerful lazer, or from orbit with less powerful lazer
- Both US and China reportedly working on the tech needded to do this from orbit

HPM (high powered microwave):
- Corrupt stored data
- Force on-board processor restart
- Circuit cooking
- Difficult for attacker to tell if they've been successful

Jamming:
- Fill EM frequency with noise
- Uplink/downlink variants

Spoofing:
- Can be done easily and cheaply, even to encrypted signals by rebroadcasting a time delayed copy

Cyber:
- 


China:
 - SJ12/GSSAP cat mouse episode early 2022
 - stole the X37b
 
 
 Russia
 - you bad so sad, all bark no bite
 - widespread jamming attempts in ukraine
 - 36 oneweb sats siezed on launchpad after refusing to give assurances that sats would not be used to support military activities, march 2022
 - keeps testing asat weapons. 2021 test created debris cloud that forced ISS to maneuver 3 times in 2022
 - Inspector sat maneuvered to loiter near 3 different commercial comms sats (long history of this behavior)
 - Newly launched sat conducted LEO flyby of NRO spy sat after only 3 days in orbit before maneuvering into same orbit plane
 - Very active in the cyber arena (hacking into sats)
 - One hour before invasion in Feb 2022 conducted cyberattack on Ukraine's ground station by downlinking disabling code from a satellite. This action also disabled wind turbines and internet access across central europe. ViaSat is not a defense contractor/paramilitary provider.

RF jamming of phased arrays (which have a narrow signal footprint) can be difficult unless you are near or inside the footprint
